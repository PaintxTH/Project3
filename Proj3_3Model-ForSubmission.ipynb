      "These gestures working together give you a feeling of greater control over your computer when otherwise using a touchpad would feel a bit cramped compared to a mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Windows 8 has started introducing gestures, but from my little bit of experience the gestures on the touchpad kind of mimic those of the touchscreen. Swipe from the right brings up Charms and swipe from the left brings up the last application. My mom has found both to occur frequently while using the touchpad and often unintentionally. In fact, my mom has asked me to disable the left swipe for application switching and the right swipe for charms leaving only two finger scroll and three finger swipe gestures. I share her sentiments. \n",

It was a different flavour of hellish, but no more pleasant. I don't even know how that happened, or if it's even possible - was that extra noise actually caused by my speakers breaking? They seem to be working well now though, though I didn't try at a high volume 'cause I'm still in recovery mode after the shock and trauma you caused me.

      "Windows vs Linux vs MacOS... Does this really have sense? Ok, first of all I've been a windows user for my entire life, from xp to windows 10. Used ubuntu, fedora and many others distro. I've got curious about mac os recently and installed a virtual machine just to try it. I've been experimenting with the os, apart from the fact that some keyboard shortcut are not the same (just habit, but after years it's hard to overwrite muscle memory), I feel like it's just a normal os, there are features that are missing from other os that would be really helpful, and there are features that i've not seen on other os that would've been helpful. Nothing more, nothing less. It seems faster, but applications take the same time to open on my windows 10 pc (took as reference all the videos I could find on the internet and a friend macbook). Talking with people I realize they've switched to apple because they've bought cheap laptops/desktops (200-400$) and then got mad when they were slow, but then bought a 1500+ mac and started making comparisons. I often hear that windows is buggy, but as I said I used windows for almost my entire life (I'm 20, 5 days to 21), the only os related bugs I had were on xp, and win 7 the first couple of years it got released. In 10+ years i encountered something like 10 blue screens, and most of those were caused by faulty drivers, and only few caused by a faulty HDD that i replaced as soon as possible. But in the last 6-7 years my windows experience was \"bugless\", and for all this time I used the same pc (2.7Ghz dual core, 2 GB of ram, GT 9400) until a year ago when everything died, and I were able to do almost everything, coding, using photoshop, illustrator, after effects, premiere, blender, unity, zbrush, solidworks, autocad, and who remembers what I also used (Yes, I like experimenting a lot), and there were times where I used the pc for 6-7 hours a day, without a single os related issue. The same thing with viruses, malwares, spywares... Never had a serious problem with those, sometimes I forgot to uncheck the \"install also *this*\" and then had to remove 1-2 spywares. I periodically ran a malware, spyware and virus scan and most of the time they found nothing, sometimes the .exes of the crack I had on the hard disk I forgot to remove. I'm not an \"everythingbutnotapple fanboy\", what I don't like about apple is just their \"hardware solutions\" and their \"marketing strategies\", the software side of apple is esthetically appealing and does its job admirably. I guess everyone who starts a battle never ever tried both os with the mindset to try the \"enemy one\" objectively and not with the \"I already know it's shit, i'll just move the mouse around a bit and then say It's buggy, it has viruses, it's slow/you can't do anything, don't have freedom, it's just for babies who needs to walk hand in hand with the os\". I also know that there're softwares that are specifically built for a professional audience and only to work on macOs (for example final cut) and therefore are fully optimized and who doesn't admit that the difference in performance is enough to make people switch to macOs (in a professional environment obiviously) is just lying to him/herself trying not compliment the other.  \n",

With the current Covid situation, we are ramping up our remote access using VMware Horizon. VMware Horizon allows us to provid students with Windows VMs with the necessary software and network access to complete coursework. Giving students access to MAC OSX is not so easy. So, according to the EULA, we cannot virtualize MAC OSX (1) on non-apple hardware (2) while we can virtualize up to two additional copies within a MAC computer, we canot use those copies for terminal sharing. Simple enough.\n",

      "How many of you feel the need for system-wise dark mode and API? One of the most annoying things of computing for me is that practically no operating system that I know of supports system-wise dark mode and API. There are something here and there, but nothing complete. E.g., iOS has Night Shift, but enabling that does not make apps switch to a dark theme. I want all applications in normal (bright?) mode when the environment is bright (day time) and in dark mode when the environment is dark (night time). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, I must search for a way to achieve \"dark mode\" per application. Not all applications support it. And even if they support it, I need to turn it on/off manually. Repeating this every day for each app is not fun. I wish there was a system-wise API so I can turn on/off for all programmes at once... or set a time-based trigger (e.g., automatically enables dark mode at 9 PM, and disables at 6 AM). Windows 10 has dark theme, but that only seems to apply to Metro apps, not to all applications such as the File Explorer. It does not provide an option to enable/disable easily or automatically (of course, you can achieve that if you have some programming skills), meaning that they did not intend it to be a solution for dark environment but rather a personal preference thing.\n",

Namely, I mapped three-finger tap to Control+Tab (to switch tabs) and three-finger click to Control+click (to open in a new tab). I've used a combination of Autohotkey and the native trackpad settings to recreate the three-finger tap functionality, but I can't find a way to map three-finger click to something. I have a precision touchpad and in doing research about this saw that non-precision trackpads have three-finger click options, so I know that this is possible on Windows.

I think that after using both, I'd be hard pressed to exchange my OSX laptop for a Windows laptop - the key feature keeping me from swaying away is gesture controls.\n",

      "3.Two fingers to the right or to the left can move back and forth in a browser. Now while I know that this is similar to three finger swipes to the right and left on some Windows 8 laptops - OSX offers you a visual hint of what's happening whether it's the self indulgent whole-page swiping away of Safari or the more modest arrow that appears with Chrome as your fingers swipe in your chosen direction. After using both my Macbook and mom's laptop, I've found I do prefer a subtle hint in this instance over the standard page change in Windows.\n",

      "\n",

      "Windows 8 has started introducing gestures, but from my little bit of experience the gestures on the touchpad kind of mimic those of the touchscreen. Swipe from the right brings up Charms and swipe from the left brings up the last application. My mom has found both to occur frequently while using the touchpad and often unintentionally. In fact, my mom has asked me to disable the left swipe for application switching and the right swipe for charms leaving only two finger scroll and three finger swipe gestures. I share her sentiments. \n",

Other extra goodies involve the touchpad being subject to the manufacturer's drivers (and whim) as opposed to a standard Windows implementation e.g. my mom's elantech touchpad drivers, upon updating, removed the option to switch reverse scrolling (which involved me rolling back the drivers).\n",

(more info below) For example, let's say that I am enjoying some MP3s with Winamp while browsing.  Suddenly, there's a Youtube video that catches my attention.  I have to go to Winamp and mute it in order to listen to the video, and then remember to press Play on it again, once the video is over and I want to continue to browse \"silent content\".  Is there a way to automate that?  It would be extremely useful for me.  Thanks in advance for your help with this!\n",

      "Windows vs Linux vs MacOS... Does this really have sense? Ok, first of all I've been a windows user for my entire life, from xp to windows 10. Used ubuntu, fedora and many others distro. I've got curious about mac os recently and installed a virtual machine just to try it. I've been experimenting with the os, apart from the fact that some keyboard shortcut are not the same (just habit, but after years it's hard to overwrite muscle memory), I feel like it's just a normal os, there are features that are missing from other os that would be really helpful, and there are features that i've not seen on other os that would've been helpful. Nothing more, nothing less. It seems faster, but applications take the same time to open on my windows 10 pc (took as reference all the videos I could find on the internet and a friend macbook). Talking with people I realize they've switched to apple because they've bought cheap laptops/desktops (200-400$) and then got mad when they were slow, but then bought a 1500+ mac and started making comparisons. I often hear that windows is buggy, but as I said I used windows for almost my entire life (I'm 20, 5 days to 21), the only os related bugs I had were on xp, and win 7 the first couple of years it got released. In 10+ years i encountered something like 10 blue screens, and most of those were caused by faulty drivers, and only few caused by a faulty HDD that i replaced as soon as possible. But in the last 6-7 years my windows experience was \"bugless\", and for all this time I used the same pc (2.7Ghz dual core, 2 GB of ram, GT 9400) until a year ago when everything died, and I were able to do almost everything, coding, using photoshop, illustrator, after effects, premiere, blender, unity, zbrush, solidworks, autocad, and who remembers what I also used (Yes, I like experimenting a lot), and there were times where I used the pc for 6-7 hours a day, without a single os related issue. The same thing with viruses, malwares, spywares... Never had a serious problem with those, sometimes I forgot to uncheck the \"install also *this*\" and then had to remove 1-2 spywares. I periodically ran a malware, spyware and virus scan and most of the time they found nothing, sometimes the .exes of the crack I had on the hard disk I forgot to remove. I'm not an \"everythingbutnotapple fanboy\", what I don't like about apple is just their \"hardware solutions\" and their \"marketing strategies\", the software side of apple is esthetically appealing and does its job admirably. I guess everyone who starts a battle never ever tried both os with the mindset to try the \"enemy one\" objectively and not with the \"I already know it's shit, i'll just move the mouse around a bit and then say It's buggy, it has viruses, it's slow/you can't do anything, don't have freedom, it's just for babies who needs to walk hand in hand with the os\". I also know that there're softwares that are specifically built for a professional audience and only to work on macOs (for example final cut) and therefore are fully optimized and who doesn't admit that the difference in performance is enough to make people switch to macOs (in a professional environment obiviously) is just lying to him/herself trying not compliment the other.  \n",

      "\n",
      "Now my answer is this: Does this everlasting battle have sense? From my experience they're operating system, and they do what they're supposed to do, apart from missing features that can still be enabled by third party apps. I just don't find enough differences to say \"this is objectively better than this\". Now, what's your opinion about this, from someone who uses macOs daily and hopefully have tried/used windows enough to make a comparison?\n",

Therefore, I gave v2.48.4 (GTK) a try. The initial scan for 129GB of data to synchronize took approximately seven hours. We do have only 100MBit LAN to our slow Windows fileserver. The initial file sync took approximately five hours. The second scan for changes took 15 minutes which is way too long in my opinion: there were no actual files synced, this is only the diff-check.  After reducing the amount of data from 129GB to 82GB by ignoring a few huge files I don't need, the scan took even longer: 22 minutes. This does not seem to be feasible in my real-world process.\n",

This could also have something to do with Apple trying to force users to migrate to the cloud service (in turn making them more money).

One of the most annoying things of computing for me is that practically no operating system that I know of supports system-wise dark mode and API. There are something here and there, but nothing complete. E.g., iOS has Night Shift, but enabling that does not make apps switch to a dark theme.

Repeating this every day for each app is not fun. I wish there was a system-wise API so I can turn on/off for all programmes at once... or set a time-based trigger (e.g., automatically enables dark mode at 9 PM, and disables at 6 AM). Windows 10 has dark theme, but that only seems to apply to Metro apps, not to all applications such as the File Explorer. It does not provide an option to enable/disable easily or automatically (of course, you can achieve that if you have some programming skills), meaning that they did not intend it to be a solution for dark environment but rather a personal preference thing.\n",
